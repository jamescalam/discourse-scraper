To this end, when I\u2019m processing my image or video sources, I need to be able to see how all the feature extractions work side-by-side.  My solution within Streamlit was to create a Dataframe with embedded PIL Images, that I use a custom formatter on.  I got the idea from here:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/stassl/displaying-inline-images-in-pandas-dataframe 41\nI would prefer to be able to simply use the Pandas Styler, but unfortunately their format does not allow the embedding of HTML currently, though it is mentioned as a possible future enhancement.\nThe other way I could work around this is by creating a custom Jinja2 template the Styler uses and repurpose the current Pandas html.tpl, see here:\n\n  \n      github.com\n  \n  \n    pandas-dev/pandas/blob/4e5c9d413ab58033529899de990bf6b25bcdeb22/pandas/io/formats/templates/html.tpl 42\n{# Update the template_structure.html document too #}\n{%- block before_style -%}{%- endblock before_style -%}\n{% block style %}\n<style  type=\"text/css\" >\n{% block table_styles %}\n{% for s in table_styles %}\n    #T_{{uuid}} {{s.selector}} {\n    {% for p,val in s.props %}\n      {{p}}: {{val}};\n    {% endfor -%}\n    }\n{%- endfor -%}\n{% endblock table_styles %}\n{% block before_cellstyle %}{% endblock before_cellstyle %}\n{% block cellstyle %}\n{%- for s in cellstyle %}\n    #T_{{uuid}}{{s.selector}} {\n    {% for p,val in s.props %}\n        {{p}}: {{val}};\n    {% endfor %}\n\n\n  This file has been truncated. show original\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nThis would in my opinion be a complete abuse of the Styler as I would have to override the displaying of the table elements in the TR block, with the undocumented r & c values which could easily be renamed in the future.\nHere is a sample of the code I use to display images within a Pandas table:\ndef get_thumbnail(path):\n  i = Image.open(path)\n  i.thumbnail((150, 150), Image.LANCZOS)\n  return i\n\ndef image_base64(im):\n  base64Image = None\n  if isinstance(im, str):\n    im = get_thumbnail(im)\n  with BytesIO() as buffer:\n    im.save(buffer, 'jpeg')\n    base64Image = base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode()\n  return base64Image\n\ndef image_formatter(im):\n  return f'<img src=\"data:image/jpeg;base64,{image_base64(im)}\">'\n\ndef run_the_app():\n...\n  df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n  st.markdown(df.to_html(formatters={'image': image_formatter}, escape=False), unsafe_allow_html=True)\n...\n\nAs you can see I perform a to_html() on the DataFrame with a custom formatter, and then pass the result to st.markdown.  While this solution meets my needs it is not ideal, as I cannot leverage the Pandas Styler as its render method will not allow disabling of escaping HTML tags.\nI hope this helps better understand my personal need of HTML.  If I may make a recommendation, remove html from markdown and make st.html() a first-class citizen. Or make PIL Images a valid type in Streamlit dataframes which get rendered in the browser.", "Thanks for the info @tbatchelli and @cajones!

Without session state, you might run into race condition issues where one user might use the language parameter of another user connected to your app."]}

I think this is the shortest path between what you want and what exists currently.\nIf you have no experience in React, it may be a good exercise to first follow the component-template tutorial 65. I also did a quick tutorial for integrating Plotly.js 43 if you want to test. They teach mostly how to pass data back and forth between Python and React though, it won\u2019t show you a lot about mapping the dataframe into a custom JS table, which the selectabledatatable example shows you.\nif you\u2019re only doing static rendering and don\u2019t plan to interact with the table, maybe it\u2019s possible to do it only with components.html actually hmmm\u2026lemme see\u2026\nFanilo", "If you\u2019re only doing static rendering (that is no interaction with the table and get back selected rows back to Streamlit) you can use components.html to run any HTML/JS code, so something like this is a good first start, maybe I\u2019d use something like jinja2 or some string interpol to inject Python data into the HTML file :\nThis is a straight very rough copy of the CDN example project 88 edited to include the Customized Table 90 you mention in your OP.

For me it seems to rerun the entire script every time, even if I only change something at the bottom of the page.\nThanks", "I am using the official SessionState but I still encounter this issue for both selectboxes and text_input (version 0.84.1).\nThe flow is that I load a data set and the first row. The sidebar widgets get populated with the features from the row and the main area shows the observed label and the prediction. The user can change the features and see how it affects the prediction. But if the user tries to change the same feature multiple times then the 2nd, 4th, 6th [\u2026] time doesn\u2019t change the feature . Only in a row though. Change feature1, then feature2, then feature1 is fine.\nWhen I load a row I put the features into dictionary in st.session_state['data'] (if it doesn\u2019t already exist). Then I point the widgets at the dictionary:\n  for cat in categorical:\n    cat_values = sorted(df[cat].unique())\n    st.session_state['data'][cat] = st.sidebar.selectbox(cat, \n                                                         options=cat_values,\n                                                         index=cat_values.index(st.session_state['data'][cat]))\n  for txt in text:\n    st.session_state['data'][txt] = st.sidebar.text_input(txt,\n                                                          value=st.session_state['data'][txt])\n\nThat way changing a value doesn\u2019t revert the value in another field. I have buttons for Next,  Previous, Random and clicking any of them deletes st.session_state['data'] and it gets recreated with the features from the new row.
